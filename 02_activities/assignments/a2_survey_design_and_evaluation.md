# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

1. Sample type
2. Sample size
3. Target population
4. Sampling frame
5. Survey mode(s) 
6. Timeline
7. Response rate
8. Weights
9. Data processing
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
11. Sources of error
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used


# Your Changes

```Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (Cycle 33):

1. Sample Type: The survey employed a stratified random sampling method to ensure representation across various demographics.

2. Sample Size: Approximately 16,149 individuals participated in the survey.

3. Target Population: Individuals aged 15 years and over residing in private households across the ten provinces of Canada. 
WWW150.STATCAN.GC.CA

4. Sampling Frame: The sampling frame was derived from the Labour Force Survey (LFS), which provides a comprehensive list of households across Canada.

5. Survey Mode(s): Data collection was conducted through telephone interviews and, for the first time in 2018, self-reported online questionnaires. 
WWW23.STATCAN.GC.CA

6. Timeline: Data was collected from September 2018 to December 2018.

7. Response Rate: The survey achieved a response rate of approximately 52.6%.

8. Weights: Survey weights were applied to adjust for non-response and to ensure that the results are representative of the Canadian population.

9. Data Processing: Collected data underwent processes such as editing, validation, and coding to ensure accuracy and consistency.

10. Cleaning and Imputation: Imputation techniques were employed to address missing data, and thorough data cleaning procedures were implemented to correct inconsistencies.

11. Sources of Error: Potential sources of error include sampling bias, non-response bias, and measurement errors inherent in self-reported data.

12. Limitations and Known Biases:

Coverage Bias: The survey excludes individuals living in the territories, institutions, or those without access to telephone or internet, potentially leading to underrepresentation of certain groups.
Social Desirability Bias: Respondents may have overreported socially favorable behaviors like volunteering or charitable giving.
Mode Effects: Differences in responses could arise between telephone interviews and online questionnaires.
13. Link to Documentation: Detailed documentation and the public use microdata file (PUMF) for the 2018 GSS can be accessed here:
